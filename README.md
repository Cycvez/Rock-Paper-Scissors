# Rock-Paper-Scissors
This was my first big project per say in learning java. out of the 4 programs in this repository
the big one is the rock paper scissors app. it lets you play RPS against the PC. grant it the
the PC only picks RPS based on random so its not machine learning or anything like that. enjoy.
